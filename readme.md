# Module 1: HTML & CSS – Layouting

The project description was to use CSS layouting formats to create a poster. I was originally inspired by a current poster/layout trend in graphic design that uses and outlines the grid, making it very visibe.

As I went forward in the project, it became less of a poster and more of a... table of information, conveying images and facts about UFOs.

I used a mixture of Flexbox and CSS Grids for positioning, layering them into one another.

The "outer grid" is used to create the scrolling marquees around the main container that has a second grid to position the information containers. Those containers then use flex to position the items within them.

The inner grid is reactive to the viewport and whether it is in landscape or portrait. Try it out.

Also—went a little nuts on the hover effects. There are 5 different hover states on the page. See if you can find them all :)
